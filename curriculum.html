    ITI Chinnaraalaya offers an internationally aligned
curriculum, which has been developed with a team of early
childhood education experts. <br>
It is based on the philosophy
that young children learn best through hands-on
experiences, exploring the surrounding and by being
inquisitive about everything.<br>
 It ensures all kinds of
intelligences that are catered through to enable learning in
every child. <br>
The curriculum has been developed keeping the
developmental milestones of children of the chosen age
group in mind and makes use of the best practices from
some of the tried and tested popular curriculum
philosophies namely:<br>

    <p class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">The Reggio Emilia Approach is an innovative and inspiring
        approach to early childhood education which values the
        child as strong, capable and resilient; rich with wonder and
        knowledge. Every child brings with them deep curiosity and
        potential and this innate curiosity drives their interest to
        understand their world and their place within it. The Reggio
        Emilia Approach originated in the town (and surrounding
        areas) of Reggio Emilia in Italy after World War II out of a
        movement towards progressive and cooperative early
        childhood education. Our early childhood teachers work
        within the guidelines by setting up the environment to act
        as a third teacher and to observe and document the child’s
        thought process thereby capturing their understanding and
        learning.</p>

    <p class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">For learning to occur, focusing on the strengths and learning
        styles of the child gives the child motivation and
        opportunity to learn in the way that the child learns best.
        This is what the Multiple Intelligences theory was proposed
        by Dr. Howard Gardner a renowned professor at Harvard
        University. According to Multiple Intelligences theory,
        everyone is born with all types of intelligences in varied
        proportions. No one form of intelligence is better than
        another, they are equally valuable an viable. By
        incorporating the theory of Multiple Inteligences in the way
        we teach, every child’s learning style and intelligences can
        be catered to.</p>

    <p class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
        Young children love to ask questions. It’s one of the ways in
which they make sense of the world and their place in it.
Questions are also a powerful tool for educators to promote
children’s thinking and learning. When children can pose
questions and investigate the answers, they feel in charge
of their own learning. Inquiry-based approaches to learning;
harnesses this spirit of investigation, creating an interesting,
engaging and meaningful curriculum that uses children’s
interests and questions as a starting point for effective
learning. Inquiry based approaches aim to encourage deep
learning- learning where children areabsorbed and
fascinated; learning where children are active and involved;
and learning where children make connection and develop
singnificant understandings.
For young children the most effective learning happens
when they have repeated opportunities to use materials
and resources to develop understanding of new concepts
and ideas. Learning also happens when they are exposed to
relevant open-ended questions that are thought provoking
and stimulate them to think and share their views. Research
suggests that using, inquiry-based learning with children
can help them become more creative, more positive and
more independent.
